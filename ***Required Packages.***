This program requires the following Python packages:

1. `torch`: This is PyTorch, an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library. It provides a wide range of algorithms for deep learning.

2. `numpy`: This is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

3. `os`: This is a built-in Python module that interfaces with the underlying operating system that Python is running on.

4. `platform`: This is also a built-in Python module that provides functions to see the platform's hardware, operating system, and interpreter version information.

5. `time`: Another built-in Python module, this one provides various time-related functions.

6. `math`: Yet another built-in Python module, this provides mathematical functions, in this case the log2 function.

You don't need to install `os`, `platform`, `time`, or `math`, as they are part of the Python standard library. However, you'll need to install `torch` and `numpy`.

Before installing these, you need Python itself installed on your system. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Python 3.8 or 3.9 is typically recommended. 

Next, it's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate your Python environment. This can be done using `venv` (built-in Python module for creating virtual environments) or `conda` (part of the Anaconda distribution).

Here's an example of how to install the necessary packages with pip, Python's package installer, after you've installed Python and created/activated a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy==1.19.2
```

The `--upgrade pip` command is used to make sure you have the latest version of pip.

If you want to use the GPU capabilities of PyTorch, you might need a specific version depending on your CUDA version. Check the PyTorch website for more details.

Remember that this script also requires a machine with CUDA-capable GPU for running the GPU-specific parts. If you don't have one, it will still run, but will skip the GPU tests.
